## Description

The Forex Breath System is an expert advisor that uses trend analysis to determine when to enter and exit trades. It is designed to be used on the H1 time frame, but this can be adjusted in the code if desired. The system sets a stop loss and take profit for each trade.

## Libraries

The code includes the necessary library 'Trade.mqh' for trading functionality.

## Variables

- `TimeFrame`: The time frame to use for analysis, default is H1.
- `StopLoss`: The stop loss in points, default is 50.0.
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit in points, default is 100.0.

## Initialization

The `OnInit` function is responsible for setting up the indicator and expert advisor properties. It sets the short name and author for the indicator, as well as the profit target and stop loss.

## Trading Logic

The `OnTick` function is where the trading logic is defined. In this sample code, there are two examples provided:

1. Buy when the trend is up: This is determined by calling the `IsTrendUp` function. If the trend is up, a buy order is opened using the `OpenBuyOrder` function.
2. Sell when the trend is down: This is determined by calling the `IsTrendDown` function. If the trend is down, a sell order is opened using the `OpenSellOrder` function.

## Custom Functions

There are four custom functions defined in this code:

- `IsTrendUp`: This function is responsible for identifying an uptrend. The code to identify the uptrend should be added here. It should return true if the trend is up, and false otherwise.
- `IsTrendDown`: This function is responsible for identifying a downtrend. The code to identify the downtrend should be added here. It should return true if the trend is down, and false otherwise.
- `OpenBuyOrder`: This function is responsible for opening a buy order. The code to open the buy order should be added here.
- `OpenSellOrder`: This function is responsible for opening a sell order. The code to open the sell order should be added here.
